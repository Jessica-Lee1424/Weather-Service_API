## Description
Create a website that allows a traveler to see the weather outlook for multiple cities.

This project is to demonstrate how an API can be used to get and post data using a server.
Successfully executing this will allow the user to enter a city and get back local weather data.
A prevalent challenge I encountered in this project was understanding how and when I needed to call the different pieces of information in order to successfully contact the server and get the information I was seeking. I worked with a program tutor, Benicio Lopes, to better understand what the necessary steps were and how to order them.
In this process, I learned how an API is used and data is rendered to the browser.

## Installation
